# Nim

Nim is a game where two players take turns picking up things from a pile. There are many different versions, but normally it is the person who picks up the last thing that loses!

## SOC Nim rules:

- The pile starts with 21 things.
- Players must take 1 or 2 things from the pile each move; they cannot take 0 or more than 2.
- The player who picks the last thing loses.
